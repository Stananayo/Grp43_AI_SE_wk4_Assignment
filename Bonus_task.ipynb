        "*   Manual API documentation is time-consuming and tedious.\n",
        "*   Documentation often becomes outdated as code evolves.\n",
        "*   Inconsistent documentation quality and completeness across projects and teams.\n",

        "*   **Purpose:** To automatically generate and maintain accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date API documentation directly from source code, comments, and runtime usage data.\n",
        "*   **Core Functionality:**\n",
        "    *   Analyze source code (e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript) to extract API endpoints, parameters, return types, and docstrings.\n",
        "    *   Process existing code comments to enrich documentation.\n",
        "    *   Optionally analyze runtime data or logs to infer API usage patterns and examples.\n",
        "    *   Generate documentation in various formats (e.g., Markdown, HTML, OpenAPI/Swagger).\n",

        "\n",
        "## Workflow\n",
        "1.  **Code Integration:** Connect AutoDocGen to the project's source code repository.\n",

        "7.  **Change Notifications:** Notify developers or documentation maintainers about significant documentation changes or detected inconsistencies.\n",
